This program aims to evaluate load and cache performance in various configurations.


Compilation :

If you do have hwloc installed, set HWLOC in Makefile to "yes". It will then
guess the number of cpu per socket. Else, set CPU_PER_SOCK in parser.h.
Default is 4.

If you want to use huge pages, set HUGEPAGES to "yes" in Makefile. if you want to use 
special hugepages (for example 1GB pages that are allowed on some architectures) make
sure you have reserved them before.
Hugepages can be reserved with the tool hugeadm, which is a wrapper for writing and reading
in this directory /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-<huge pages sizes>/
These files can also be directly written.

Reserving hugepages requires root priviledges.


Usage :

./load -n<number of threads> -slow=<number of slow threads> -spread=<close|spread>
-size=<size of array per thread> -ratio=<size of slow threads datas / size of fast threads data>

This program asks user to enter threads sizes one by one. Press enter again when finished. 
You may enter as many sizes as you wish.
If you did not enter any inputs (or only invalid ones), it will use arguments passed in command
lines if any, and at last default values.

Alternative usage:

you can write your inputs in a file and pass this file as standard input. For example,
modify the file threadsizes according to your needs and do 

cat threadsizes | ./load

arguments :

size is in power of two, -size=4 will make each thread load an array of 2^4 doubles.
Default is 20.

Default for n is NCPU_PER_SOCK

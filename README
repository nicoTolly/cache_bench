This program aims to evaluate load and cache performance in various configurations.


Compilation :

If you do have hwloc installed, set HWLOC in Makefile to "yes". It will then
guess the number of cpu per socket. Else, set CPU_PER_SOCK in parser.h.
Default is 4.


Usage :

./load -n<number of threads> -slow=<number of slow threads> -spread=<close|spread>
-size=<size of array per thread>


size is in power of two, -size=4 will make each thread load an array of 2^4 doubles.
Default is 20.

Default for n is NCPU_PER_SOCK
